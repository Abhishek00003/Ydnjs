# You Don't Know JS: *this* & Object Prototypes
# Chapter 5: Prototypes

In the Chapters 3 and 4, we mentioned the `[[Prototype]]` chain several times, but haven't said what exactly it is. We will now examine prototypes in detail.

## Links

Objects in JavaScript have an internal property, denoted in the specification as `[[Prototype]]`, which is simply a reference to another object. Almost all objects are given a non-`null` value for this property, at the time of their creation. However, we will see shortly that it *is* possible to have an empty `[[Prototype]]` linkage.

Consider:

```js
var myObject = {
	a: 2
};

myObject.a; // 2
```

What is the `[[Prototype]]` reference used for? In Chapter 3, we examined the `[[Get]]` operation that is invoked when you reference a property on an object, such as `myObject.a`. For that default `[[Get]]` operation, the first step is to check if the object itself has a property `a` on it, and if so, it's used.

But it's what happens if `a` **isn't** present on `myObject` that brings our attention now to the `[[Prototype]]` link of the object.

The default `[[Get]]` operation proceeds to follow the `[[Prototype]]` **link** of the object if it cannot find the requested property on the object directly. So, if for instance `a` is not present on `myObject`, but `myObject` has an internal `[[Prototype]]` link to another object `anotherObject`, the look-up will follow the linkage chain to `anotherObject` and inquire whether *it* has the property `a`.

```js
var anotherObject = {
	a: 42
};

// create an object linked to `anotherObject`
var myObject = Object.create(anotherObject);

myObject.a; // 42
```

**Note:** We will explain what `Object.create(..)` does, and how it operates, shortly. For now, just assume it creates an object with the `[[Prototype]]` linkage we're examining.

If `a` weren't found on `anotherObject` either, the `[[Prototype]]` chain, if non-empty, is again consulted and followed.

This process continues until either a matching property name is found, or the `[[Prototype]]` chain ends. If no matching property is found, the return result from the `[[Get]]` operation is `undefined`.

### `Object.prototype`

But *where* exactly does the `[[Prototype]]` chain "end"?

The top-end of every *standard* `[[Prototype]]` chain is the built-in `Object.prototype`. This object includes a variety of common utilities used all over JS, because all normal (built-in, not host-specific extension) objects in JavaScript "descend from" (aka, have at the top of their `[[Prototype]]` chain) the `Object.prototype` object.

Some utilities found here you may be familiar with include `.toString()` and `.valueOf()`. In Chapter 3, we introduced another: `.hasOwnProperty(..)`. And yet another function on `Object.prototype` you may not be familiar with, but which we'll address later in this chapter, is `.isPrototypeOf(..)`.

At this point, you might be wondering: "*Why* does one object need to link to another object?" What's the real benefit? That is a very appropriate question to ask, but we must first understand what `[[Prototype]]` is **not** before we can fully understand and appreciate what it *is* and how it's useful.

## "Class"

As we explained in Chapter 4, in JavaScript, there are no abstract patterns/blueprints for objects called "classes" as there are in class-oriented languages. JavaScript **just** has objects.

In fact, JavaScript is **almost unique among languages as perhaps the only language with the right to use the label "object oriented", because it's one of a very short list of languages where an object can be created directly, without a class at all.

In JavaScript, classes can't (being that they don't exist!) describe what an object can do. The object defines its own behavior directly. **There's *just* the object.**

### "Class" Functions

There's a peculiar kind of behavior in JavaScript that has been shamelessly abused for years to *hack* something that *looks* like "classes". We'll examine this approach in detail.

The peculiar "sort-of class" behavior hinges on a strange characteristic of functions: all functions by default get a public, non-enumerable (see Chapter 3) property on them called `prototype`, which points at an otherwise arbitrary object.

```js
function foo() {
	// ...
}

foo.prototype; // { }
```

This object is often called "foo's prototype", because we access it via an unfortunately-named property `foo.prototype`. However, that terminology is hopelessly destined to lead us into confusion, as we'll see shortly. Instead, I will call it "the object formerly known as foo's prototype". Just kidding. How about: "object arbitrarily labeled 'foo dot prototype'"?

What exactly is this *arbitrary* object?

The most direct way to explain it is that each object created from calling the `foo()` function with the `new` operator (see Chapter 2) will end up (somewhat aribitrarily) `[[Prototyped]]`-linked to this "foo dot prototype" object.

Let's illustrate:

```js
function Foo() {
	// ...
}

var a = new Foo();

Object.getPrototypeOf( a ) === Foo.prototype; // true
```

When `a` is created by calling `new Foo()`, one of the things (see Chapter 2 for all *four* steps) that happens is that `a` gets an internal `[[Prototype]]` link to the same object that `Foo.prototype` is pointing at.

Stop for a moment and ponder the implications of that statement.

In class-oriented languages, multiple **copies** (aka, "instances") of a class can be made, like stamping something out from a mold. As we saw in Chapter 4, this happens because the process of instantiating (or inheriting from) a class means, "copy the behavior plan from that class into a physical object", and this is done again for each new instance.

But in JavaScript, there are no such copy-actions performed. You don't create multiple instances of a class. You can create multiple objects that `[[Prototype]]` *link* to a common object. But by default, no copying occurs, and thus these objects don't end up totally separate and disconnected from each other, but rather, quite ***linked***.

`new Foo()` results in a new object (we called it `a`), and **that** new object `a` is internally `[[Prototype]]` linked to the `Foo.prototype` object.

**We ended up with two objects, linked to each other. **That's *it*. We didn't instantiate a class. We certainly didn't do any copying of behavior from one "class" into a concrete object. We just caused two objects to be linked to each other.

In fact, the secret, which eludes most JS developers, is that the `new Foo()` function calling had really almost nothing *direct* to do with the process of creating the link. **It was sort of an accidental side-effect.** `new Foo()` is an indirect, round-about way to end up with what we want: **a new object linked to another object**.

Can we get what we want in a more *direct* way? **Yes!** The hero is `Object.create(..)`. But, hold that excitement for a bit.

#### What's in a name?

In JavaScript, we don't make *copies* from one object ("class") to another ("instance"). We make *links* between objects. For the `[[Prototype]]` mechanism, visually, the arrows move from right to left, and from bottom to top.

<img src="fig2.png">

This mechanism is often called "prototypal inheritance" (we'll explore the code in detail shortly), which is commonly said to be the dynamic-language version of "classical inheritance". It's an attempt to piggy-back on the common understanding of what "inheritance" means in the class-oriented world, but *tweak* (**read: pave over**) the understood semantics, to fit dynamic scripting.

The word "inheritance" has a very strong meaning, with plenty of mental precedent. Merely adding "prototypal" in front to distinguish the *actually nearly opposite* behavior in JavaScript has left in its wake nearly two decades of mirey confusion.

I like to say that sticking "prototypal" in front "inheritance" to drastically reverse its actual meaning is like me holding an orange in one hand, an apple in the other, and insisting on calling the apple a "red orange". No matter what confusing label I put in front of it, that doesn't change the *fact* that one is an apple and one is an orange.

The better approach is to plainly call an apple an apple. That makes it easier to understand both their similarities and their **many differences**, because we all have a simple, shared understanding of what "apple" meaning.

Because of the confusion and conflation of terms, I believe the label "prototypal inheritance" itself (and trying to mis-apply all its associated class-orientation terminology, like "class", "constructor", "instance", "polymorphism", etc) has done **more harm than good** in explaining how JavaScript's mechanism *really* works.

"Inheritance" implies a *copy* operation, and JavaScript doesn't copy object properties (natively, by default). Instead, JS creates a link between two objects, where one object can essentially *delegate* property/function access to another object. "Delegation" (see Chapter 6) is a much more accurate term for JavaScript's object-linking mechanism.

Another term which is sometimes thrown around in JavaScript is "differential inheritance". The idea here is that we describe an object's behavior in terms of what is different from a more general descriptor. For example, you explain that a car is a vehicle but one that has exactly 4 wheels, rather than re-describing all the specifics of what makes up a general vehicle (engine, etc).

If you try to think of any given object in JS as the sum total of all behavior that is *available* via delegation, and **in your mind you flatten** all that behavior into one tangible *thing*, then you can (sorta) see how "differential inheritance" might fit.

But just like with "prototypal inheritance", "differential inheritance" pretends that your mental model is more important than what is physcially happening in the language. It overlooks the fact that object `B` is not actually differentially constructed, but is instead built with specific characteristics defined, alongside "holes" where nothing is defined. It is in these "holes" (gaps in definition) that delegation takes over and, on the fly, "fills them in" with delegated behavior.

The object is not, by native default, flattened into the single differential object, **through copying**, that the mental model of "differential inheritance" implies. As such, "differential inheritance" is just not as natural a fit for describing how JavaScript's `[[Prototype]]` mechanism actually works.

You *can choose* to prefer "differential inheritance" terminology as a matter of taste, but there's no denying the fact that it *only* fits the mental acrobatics in your mind, not the physical behavior in the code.

### "Constructors"

Let's go back to some earlier code:

```js
function Foo() {
	// ...
}

var a = new Foo();
```

What exactly leads us to think `Foo` is a "class"?

For one, we see the use of the `new` keyword, just like class-oriented languages do when they construct class instances. For another, it appears that we are in fact executing a *constructor* method of a class, because `Foo()` is actually a method that gets called, just like how a real class's constructor gets called when you instantiate that class.

To further the confusion of "constructor" semantics, the arbitrarily labeled `Foo.prototype` object has another trick up its sleeve. Consider this code:

```js
function Foo() {
	// ...
}

Foo.prototype.constructor === Foo; // true

var a = new Foo();
a.constructor === Foo; // true
```

The `Foo.prototype` object by default (at declaration time on line 1 of the snippet!) gets a public, non-enumerable (see Chapter 3) property called `.constructor`, and this property is a reference back to the function (`Foo` in this case) where the object is associated with. Moreover, we see that objects (like `a`) created by the "constructor" call `new Foo()` *seem* to also have a property on them called `.constructor` which similarly points to the "function which created them".

**Note:** This is not actually true. `a` has no `.constructor` property on it, and though `a.constructor` does in fact resolve to the `Foo` function, "constructor" **does not actually mean** "was constructed by", as it appears. We'll explain this strangeness shortly.

Oh, yeah, also... by convention in the JavaScript world, "class"es are named with a capital letter, so the fact that it's `Foo` instead of `foo` is a strong clue that we intend it to be a "class". That's totally obvious to you, right!?

**Note:** This convention is so strong that many JS linters actually *complain* if you call `new` on a method with a lowercase name, or if we don't call `new` on a function that happens to start with a capital letter. That sort of boggles the mind that we struggle so much to get (fake) "class-orientation" *right* in JavaScript that we create linter rules to ensure we use capital letters, even though the capital letter doesn't mean ***anything* at all** to the JS engine.

### Mechanics

Are *those* the only common triggers for ill-fated "class" discussions in JavaScript?

**Not quite.** JS developers have strived to simulate as much as they can of class-orientation:

```js
function Foo(name) {
	this.name = name;
}

Foo.prototype.myName = function() {
	return this.name;
};

var a = new Foo("a");
var b = new Foo("b");

a.myName(); // "a"
b.myName(); // "b"
```

This snippet shows two additional "class-orientation" tricks in play:

1. `this.name = name`: adds the `.name` property onto each object (`a` and `b`, respectively; see Chapter 2 about `this` binding), similar to how class instances encapsulate data values.

2. `Foo.prototype.myName = ...`: perhaps the more interesting technique, this adds a property (function) to the `Foo.prototype` object. Now, `a.myName()` works, but perhaps surprisingly. How?

In the above snippet, it's strongly tempting to think that when `a` and `b` are created, the properties/functions on the `Foo.prototype` object are *copied* over to each of `a` and `b` objects. However, that's not what happens.

At the beginning of this chapter, we explained the `[[Prototype]]` link, and how it provides the fall-back look-up steps if a property reference isn't found directly on an object, as part of the default `[[Get]]` algorithm.

So, by virtue of how they are created, `a` and `b` each end up with an internal `[[Prototype]]` linkage to `Foo.prototype`. When `myName` is not found on `a` or `b`, respectively, it's instead found, through delegation, on `Foo.prototype`.

#### "Constructor" Redux

Recall the discussion from earlier about the `.constructor` property, and how it *seems* like `a.constructor === Foo` being true means that `a` has an actual `.constructor` property on it, pointing at `Foo`? **Not correct.**

This is just unfortunate confusion. In actuality, the `.constructor` reference is also *delegated* up to `Foo.prototype`, which **happens to**, by default, have a `.constructor` that points at `Foo`.

It *seems* awfully convenient that an object `a` "constructed by" `Foo` would have a `.constructor` property on it that points to `Foo`. But that's nothing more than a false sense of security. It's a happy accident, almost tangentially, that `a.constructor` *happens* to point at `Foo` via this default `[[Prototype]]` delegation. There's actually several ways that the ill-fated assumption of `.constructor` meaning "was constructed by" can come back to bite you.

For one, the `.constructor` property on `Foo.prototype` is only there by default on the object created when `Foo` the function is declared. If you create a new object, and replace a function's default `.prototype` object reference, the new object will not by default magically get a `.constructor` on it. You can add one, but this takes manual work, especially if you want to match native behavior and have it be non-enumerable (see Chapter 3).

For example:

```js
function Foo() { /* .. */ }

Foo.prototype = { /* .. */ }; // create a new prototype object

// Need to properly "fix" the missing `.constructor`
// property on the new object serving as `Foo.prototype`.
// See Chapter 3 for `defineProperty(..)`.
Object.defineProperty( Foo.prototype, "constructor" , {
	enumerable: false,
	writable: true,
	configurable: true,
	value: Foo    // point `.constructor` at `Foo`
} );
```

That's a lot of manual work to fix `.constructor`. Moreover, all we're really doing is perpetuating the misconception that "constructor" means "was constructed by". That's an *expensive* illusion.

The fact is, `.constructor` on an object arbitrarily points, by default, at a function who, reciprocally, has a reference back to the object, called `.prototype`. The words "constructor" and "prototype" only have a loose default meaning that might or might not be true later. The best thing to do is remind yourself, "constructor does not mean constructed by".

`.constructor` is not a magic immutable property. It *is* non-enumerable (see snippet above), but its value is writable (can be changed), and moreover, you can add or overwrite (intentionally or accidentally) a property of the name `constructor` on any object in any `[[Prototype]]` chain, with any value you see fit.

By virtue of how the `[[Get]]` algorithm traverses the `[[Prototype]]` chain, a `.constructor` property reference found anywhere may resolve quite differently than you'd expect. See how arbitrary its meaning actually is?

The result? Some arbitrary object-property reference like `a.constructor` cannot actually be *trusted* to have the assumed default function reference. Moreover, as we'll see shortly, just by simple omission, `a.constructor` can even end up pointing somewhere quite surprising and insensible.

`a.constructor` is extremely unreliable, and an unsafe reference to rely upon in your code. **Generally, such references should be avoided where possible.**

## "(Prototypal) Inheritance"

We've seen some approximations of "class" mechanics as typically hacked into JavaScript programs. But JavaScript "class"es would be rather hollow if we didn't have an approximation of "inheritance".

Actually, we've already seen the mechanism which is commonly called "prototypal inheritance" at work when `a` was able to "inherit from" `Foo.prototype`, and thus get access to the `myName()` function. But we traditionally think of "inheritance" as being a relationship between two "classes", rather than between "class" and "instance".

<img src="fig2.png">

Recall this figure from earlier, which shows not only delegation from an object (aka, "instance") `a1` to object `Foo.prototype`, but from `Bar.prototype` to `Foo.prototype`, which somewhat resembles the concept of Parent-Child class inheritance. *Resembles*, except of course for the direction of the arrows, which show these are delegation links rather than copy operations.

And, here's how we create such links in JS:

```js
function Foo(name) {
	this.name = name;
}

Foo.prototype.myName = function() {
	return this.name;
};

function Bar(name,label) {
	Foo.call( this, name );
	this.label = label;
}

// here, we link `Bar.prototype` to `Foo.prototype`
Bar.prototype = Object.create( Foo.prototype );

// Remember, now `Bar.prototype.constructor` is gone,
// and might need to be manually "fixed"

Bar.prototype.myLabel = function() {
	return this.label;
};

var a = new Bar( "a", "obj a" );
a.myName(); // "a"
a.myLabel(); // "obj a"
```

**Note:** To understand why `this` points to `a` in this code snippet, see Chapter 2.

The important part is `Bar.prototype = Object.create( Foo.prototype )`. `Object.create(..)` *creates* a "new" object out of thin air, and links that new object's internal `[[Prototype]]` to the object you specify (`Foo.prototype` in this case).

What that line says is: "make a *new* Bar prototype object that's linked to Foo's prototype".

When `function Bar() { .. }` is declared, `Bar`, like any other function, has a `.prototype` link to its default object. But *that* object is not linked to `Foo.prototype` like we want. So, we create a *new* object that *is* linked as we want, effectively throwing away the original non-linked object.

**Note:** A common mis-conception/confusion here is that either of these approaches would *also* work, but they do not work as you'd expect:

```js
// doesn't work like you want
Bar.prototype = Foo.prototype;

// works like you want, but with side-effects you don't want
Bar.prototype = new Foo();
```

`Bar.prototype = Foo.prototype` doesn't create a new object for `Bar` to be linked to. It just points `Bar.prototype` as another reference to `Foo.prototype`, which effectively links `Bar` directly to **the same object as** `Foo` links to: `Foo.prototype`. This means when you start assigning, like `Bar.prototype.myLabel = ...`, you're modifying **not a separate object** but *the* shared `Foo.prototype` object itself, which is almost certainly not what you want. If it *is* what you want, then you likely don't need `Bar` at all, and should just use only `Foo` and make your code simpler.

`Bar.prototype = new Foo()` **does in fact** create a new object which is duly linked to `Foo.prototype` as we'd want. But, it used the `Foo(..)` "constructor" function to do it. If that function has any side-effects (such as logging, changing state, registering against other objects, **adding data properties to `this`**, etc), those side-effects happen at the time of this linking (and likely against the wrong object!), rather than only when the eventual `Bar()` "descendents" are created, as would likely be expected.

So, we're left with using `Object.create(..)` to make a new object that's properly linked, but without having the side-effects of calling `Foo(..)`. The slight downside is that we have to create a new object, throwing the old one away, instead of modifying the existing default object we're provided.

It would be *nice* if there was a standard and reliable way to modify the linkage of an existing object. Prior to ES6, there's a non-standard and not fully-cross-browser way, via the `.__proto__` property. ES6 adds a `Object.setPrototypeOf(..)`, which does the trick.

Compare the pre-ES6 and ES6-standardized techniques, side-by-side:

```js
// pre-ES6
Bar.prototype = Object.create( Foo.prototype );

// ES6+
Object.setPrototypeOf( Bar.prototype, Foo.prototype );
```

Ignoring the slight performance disadvantage of the `Object.create(..)` approach, it's a little bit shorter and may be perhaps a little easier to read than the ES6+ approach. But it's probably a wash either way.

### Reflection

What if you have an object like `a` and want to find out what object (if any) it delegates to? Inspecting an instance (just an object in JS) for its inheritance ancestry (delegation linkage in JS) is often called *reflection* (or *introspection*) in traditional class-oriented environments.

Consider:

```js
function Foo() {
	// ...
}

Foo.prototype.blah = ...;

var a = new Foo();
```

How do we then reflect on `a` to find out its "ancestry" (delegation linkage)? The first approach embraces the "class" confusion:

```js
a instanceof Foo; // true
```

The `instanceof` operator takes a plain object as its left-hand operand and a function as its right-hand operand. The question `instanceof` answers is: **in the entire `[[Prototype]]` chain of `a`, does the object arbitrarily pointed to by `Foo.prototype` ever appear?**

Unfortunately, this means that you can only inquire about the "ancestry" of some object (`a`) if you have some **function** (`Foo`, with its attached `.prototype` reference) to test with. If you have two arbitrary objects, say `a` and `b`, and want to find out if *the objects* are related to each other through a `[[Prototype]]` chain, `instanceof` leaves you out of luck.

This snippet illustrates the ridiculousness of trying to reason about relationships between two objects using "class" semantics:

```js
function isRelatedTo(o1, o2) {
	function F(){}
	F.prototype = o2;
	return o1 instanceof F;
}

var a = {};
var b = Object.create(a);

isRelatedTo(b, a); // true
```

Inside `isRelatedTo(..)`, we borrow a throw-away function `F`, reassign its `.prototype` to arbitrarily point to some object `o2`, then ask if `o1` is an "instance of" `F`. Obviously `o1` wasn't *actually* inherited or descended or constructed from `F`, so it should be clear why this kind of exercise is silly and confusing. **The problem comes down to the awkwardness of class semantics forced onto JavaScript**, in this case as revealed by the indirect semantics of `instanceof`.

The second approach to `[[Prototype]]` reflection is:

```js
Foo.prototype.isPrototypeOf( a ); // true
```

Notice that in this case, we don't really care (or even *need*) `Foo`, we just need an **object** (in our case, arbitrarily labeled `Foo.prototype`) to test against another **object**. The question `isPrototypeOf(..)` answers is: **in the entire `[[Prototype]]` chain of `a`, does `Foo.prototype` ever appear?**

Same question, and exact same answer. But in this second approach, we don't need the indirection of referencing **function** whose `.prototype` property will automatically be consulted. We *just need* two **objects**, for example:

```js
// Simply: does `b` appear in `c`s [[Prototype]] chain?
b.isPrototypeOf( c );
```

Notice, this approach doesn't require a `Foo` function. It just uses object references directly to `b` and `c`, and inquires about their relationship.

In either case, though, what's happening implicitly is that the internal `[[Prototype]]` of an object is retrieved, and compared against another object for equality.

We can also directly retrieve the `[[Prototype]]` of an object. As of ES5, the standard way to do this is:

```js
Object.getPrototypeOf( a );
```

And you'll notice that object reference is what we'd expect:

```js
Object.getPrototypeOf( a ) === Foo.prototype; // true
```

Prior to ES5, most browsers (not all!) supported a (then) non-standard alternate way of accessing the internal `[[Prototype]]`:

```js
a.__proto__ === Foo.prototype; // true
```

The strange `.__proto__` property "magically" retrieves the internal `[[Prototype]]` as an object reference, which is quite helpful if you want to directly inspect (or even traverse: `.__proto__.__proto__...`) the chain.

Just as we saw earlier with `.constructor`, `.__proto__` doesn't actually exist on the object you're inspecting (`a` in our running example). In fact, it exists (non-enumerable; see Chapter 2) on the built-in `Object.prototype`, along with other common utilities (`.toString()`, `.isPrototypeOf(..)`, etc).

Moreover, `.__proto__` looks like a property, but it's actually more appropriate to think of it as a getter/setter (see Chapter 3).

Roughly, we could envision `.__proto__` implemented (see Chapter 3 for object property definitions) like this:

```
Object.defineProperty( Object.prototype, "__proto__", {
	get: function() {
		return Object.getPrototypeOf( this );
	},
	set: function(o) {
		// setPrototypeOf(..) landed in ES6
		Object.setPrototypeOf( this, o );
		return o;
	}
} );
```

So, when we access (retrieve the value of) `a.__proto__`, it's like saying `a.__proto__()` (calling the getter function). *That* function call has `a` as its `this` even though the getter function exists way up on the `Object.prototype` object (see Chapter 2 for `this` binding rules), so it's just like saying `Object.getPrototypeOf( a )`.

Yes, `.__proto__` is also a set'able property, just like `Object.setPrototypeOf(..)`. However, generally you **should not change the `[[Prototype]]` of an existing object**. There are some extremely complex advanced techniques used deep in some frameworks that allow tricks like "subclassing" an `Array`, but this is usually frowned on in general programming practice, as it usually leads to harder to understand/maintain code.

The only other narrow exception (as seen earlier) would be setting a default function `.prototype` object's `[[Prototype]]` to some other object, instead of replacing the default object entirely with a new linked object. Other than this, **it's best to treat object `[[Prototype]] linkage as a read-only characteristic** for ease-of-reading of your code.

**Note:** The JavaScript community unofficially coined a term for the double-underscore, specifically the leading one in properties like `__proto__`: "dunder". So, the "cool kids" in JavaScript would generally pronounce `__proto__` as "dunder proto".

## Review (TL;DR)

When attempting a property access on an object that doesn't have that property, the object's internal `[[Prototype]]` linkage defines where the `[[Get]]` operation (see Chapter 3) should look next. This cascading linkage from object to object essentially defines a "prototype chain" (somewhat similar to a nested scope chain) of objects to traverse for property resolution.

All normal objects have the built-in `Object.prototype` as the top of the prototype chain (like the global scope in scope look-up), where property resolution will stop if not found anywhere prior in the chain. `toString()`, `valueOf()`, and several other common utilities exist on this `Object.prototype` object, explaining how all objects in the language are able to access them.

The most common way to get two objects linked to each other is using the `new` keyword with a function call, which among its four steps (see Chapter 2), it creates a new object linked to another object.

The "another object" that the new object is linked to happens to be the object referenced by the arbitrarily named `.prototype` property of the function called with `new`. Functions called with `new` are often called "constructors", despite the fact that they are not actually instantiating a class as *constructors* do in traditional class-oriented languages.

While these JavaScript mechanisms can seem to resemble "class instantiation" and "class inheritance" from traditional class-oriented languages, the key distinction is that in JavaScript, no copies are made. Rather, objects end up linked to each other via `[[Prototype]]`.

For a variety of reasons, not the least of which is terminology precedent, "inheritance" (and "prototypal inheritance") and all the other OO terms just do not make sense when considering how JavaScript *actually* works (not just our forced mental models). Instead, as we'll see in the next chapter, "delegation" is a more appropriate term, because these relationships are not *copies* but **links**.
