# You Don't Know JS: ES6 & Beyond
# Chapter 7: Meta Programming

Meta Programming is programming where the operation targets the behavior of the program itself. In other words, it's programming the programming of your program. Yeah, a mouthful, huh!?

For example, if you probe the relationship between one object `a` and another `b` -- are they `[[Prototype]]` linked? -- using `a.isPrototype(b)`, this is commonly referred to as introspection, a form of meta programming. Macros (which don't exist in JS, yet) --  where the code modifies itself at compile time -- are another common example of meta programming.

The goal of meta programming is to leverage the language's own intrinsic capabilities to make the rest of your code more descriptive, expressive, and/or flexible. Because of the *meta* nature of meta programming, it's somewhat difficult to put a more precise definition on it than that. The best way to understand meta programming is to see it through example.

ES6 adds a few new forms/features for meta programming which we'll briefly review here.

## Function Names

There are cases where your code may want to introspect on itself and ask what the name of some function is. For instance, you may need to notify some other part of the system what function to invoke at a later time, but you may not be able to just pass around a reference to the function itself.

If you ask what a function's name is, the answer you get is surprisingly somewhat ambiguous. Consider:

```js
function daz() {
	// ..
}

var obj = {
	foo: function() {
		// ..
	},
	bar: function baz() {
		// ..
	},
	bam: daz,
	zim() {
		// ..
	}
};
```

In this previous snippet, "what is the name of `obj.foo()`" is slightly nuanced. Is it `"foo"` or is undefined? And what about `obj.bar()` -- is it named `"bar"` or `"baz"`? Is `obj.bam()` named `"bam"` or `"daz"`? What about `obj.zim()`?

Moreover, what about functions which are passed as callbacks, like:

```js
function foo(cb) {
	// what is the name of `cb()` here?
}

foo( function(){
	// I'm anonymous!
} );
```

There are quite a few ways that functions can be expressed in programs, and it's not always clear and unambiguous what the "name" of that function should be.

More importantly, we need to distinguish whether the "name" of a function refers to its `name` property -- yes, functions have a property called `name` -- or whether it refers to the lexical binding name, such as `bar` in `function bar() { .. }`.
